Situation:
- 2 contracts come in at the same time
- How to assign crew appropriately to each delivery

Need to Know:
- Indicator if crew member is available/busy
- Actual begin or end dates for delivery 
- How to schedule future deliveries

Migrate to Postgres




Flask
 - need a design before getting started
 - end user, what happens behind the scenes, and what do THEY see
 - I think it'd be cool to have both, but maybe do the internal first - we can play w fake package requests
 - serve up the package requests, deal with scheduling, how many at a time, if close to certain planets?

Infa-y stuff
 - Migrate to Postgres
 - will need a user and the DB

Cleanup
 - hardcoded ports and such, config for that

Convert to Ruby-Rails project instead
